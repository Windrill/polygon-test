tested:
- polyton mesh consists of vertices (VV) and lines, not coupled/sorted
- faces are implied, and calculated through looping vertices
- line segmenting

next:
- group common functions (triangle area, w/ options eg. point/angle/line)
- check color-picker common code
- triangulation: anything other than 'ear picking'? also, check positive/negative degrees for concave polygons
- decision to update 'area' and other 'calculations', register polygon to those updates
